# MovieOrder
A javafx desktop application to manage the series you have in you hard drive.

This application runs vlc video player to play series, I've only tested 
it on linux.

I made this application for myself, it does what I need it to do in my 
specific case, I wouldn't expect it to work for other people but feel 
free to fork and adapt it to your needs or even do a pull request :).
